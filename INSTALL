Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and Type 
     `make' to compile the package. 
         
         -- On HP-UX systems use gmake --

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make distclean'.

  5. To remove the program completely you can type 'make uninstall'

  6. If you want to create a rpm installation package then you just need to type
     'rpm -tb <the tar.gz file>'
