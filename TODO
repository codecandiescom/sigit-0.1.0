  ( this is scheduled to apear in the 0.2 versions of this program, so please understand 
    the 0.1.x versions might be extreme unstable. )

* Make it act, so that a single running copy of the program can deal with multiple 
     .signature files. Say you like writing to alot of newsgroups, but all the 
      signatures with "Linux ROCKS!!" quotes shouldn't be send to the windows dealing
      newsgroups. So in your role/rule in pine sets it to use .sigit-win if your reply
      should be to a *win* newsgroup, and if it's a *linux* group, then use .signature-lin. 
      However this requires some pthreading of the program, and to be frank, I havn't 
      got the slightest idear how this should be dealth with. 
      It would have to be some nonblocking way of having multiple fifos running at the same
      time, from the same instance of the program.

* Perhaps make a better and less space consuming way of storing the signature.
     Could be done with adding gzip support in the program, so the signatures 
     are stored in a gzip'ed file.

* Make a configure script for it, but since it dosn't realy require anything, 
     I cant see the real use in it. Would be kinda cool to have tho.
