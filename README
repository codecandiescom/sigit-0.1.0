Sigit 0.1.0


Installation for RPM based systems:
Use rpm -tb <the tar.gz file> to build a binary RPM for sigit. Use
rpm -i or your favourite tool to install.

Installation without RPM:
1. Review the Makefile. Check the location of the "install" command and
   choose the CFLAGS to suite your taste.
2. If any changes were made to the prefered install setting, chenck the 
   config.h file and accordingly change the setting for DEFAULT_DATA_FILE. 
3. A different installation directory can be specified by using
   'make PREFIX=/your/dir install'

Additional hints:
1. This version has changed quite alot, if you are using a future version
   you will need to rebuild the data file since I have changed the very first
   thing it reads from the file, so on first read, it will off. 

2. On HP-UX systems use gmake, and for some reason the data file can't be
   build correct. I suspects this to be a big/little endian problem.
 

Limitations:
It seems to be usign less memory than fetchmail, so if your not 
intimidated to be running fetchmail, then this won't harm your machine.
